# Competitive Programming Template
    

## What
C++11 or newer template for competitive programming, with create_snippet script for vscode user snippet. Made by me, for myself.

## Why
- Want to solve Div2 A in sub one minute
- Want to solve a lot of DS problems with only headache (not wristache)
- Slowhand
- Find boring 𝓪𝓱𝓱 2d segment tree problem

## How
1. Compile create_snippet.cpp
2. Read the comment at first ~10 lines of create_snippet.cpp
4. Put the resulting string on vscode by pressing `ctrl`+`shift`+`p` -> snippet: configure snippets -> new global snippets file
8. Use them on any .cpp file by writing the prefix

## When

## Where
